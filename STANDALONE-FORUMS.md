3. **Independent Bootstrap**: `client/src/forum-main.tsx` - dedicated React app bootstrap
4. **Multi-page Build**: Vite configured to build both main app and standalone forums

### Privacy Simplifications
- **Removed complex admin system** - no admin accounts, permissions, or moderation panel
- **Removed user registration** - only anonymous posting
- **Removed audit logging** - no tracking of user actions
- **Removed session management** - simplified to just anonymous names
- **Removed email/personal data paths** - no mechanisms to collect or display personal information

### Data Storage
- **Forum boards**: `localStorage.getItem('standalone-forum-boards')`
