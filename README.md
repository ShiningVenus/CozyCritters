> A complete production ready app designed specifically for neurodivergent minds.

**Transparent**: This was made with the help of ChatGPT, Copilot, Replit, and Codex. This is just a personal hobby project and I am studying and learning code still myself. I am a solo person working on this for fun.

Cozy Critter is a private mood tracking app that actually understands ND life.
It is open source and simple to self-host.

What makes it different:
- 🚫 No overwhelming interfaces
- 🚫 No judgment
- 🚫 No data harvesting
- ✨ Just you, cute animals, and a safe place for your feelings

Check in with adorable animal emoji, add your own notes when you want to, and get encouragement that really gets masking, sensory overwhelm, and executive function struggles.

Everything stays on your device because your emotional data is deeply personal.

### 🖥️ Backend (Optional/Future)
- Express.js with TypeScript
- Supabase (managed PostgreSQL) via Drizzle ORM
  - Reusable `requestLogger` middleware for development visibility
- Currently Not Required — App works without a backend

### ♿ Accessibility & Design

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

### Quick Start (3 steps)

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

2. Start the dev server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

3. Open in your browser
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

That's it! 🎉 No database setup, no API keys, no complicated configuration.

### Tests
```bash
npm test
```


## 🏭 Production Install

For a production-ready build use the helper script:

```bash
# install dependencies and build
./install-frontend.sh

# launch immediately
./install-frontend.sh start

# or manage with PM2
./install-frontend.sh pm2
```

The script checks for Node.js ≥ 18 and will print a sample systemd unit file when run with `systemd`.

## 🔐 Privacy Promise + Technical Proof

### 🎯 Our Claims

| Promise | What This Means |
|---------|------------------|
| No tracking, no data collection | We literally cannot see your data |
| Everything stays on your device | Uses browser localStorage only |
| One click delete everything | Prove your privacy is real |
| Works offline | No internet required after first load |
| No external dependencies | Your mood data never leaves your device |

---

### 🔍 Verify Our Security Claims Yourself

Don't trust us — verify us!

Here's how to prove Cozy Critter's security claims with your own eyes:

### 🕵️ 5 Ways to Verify Our Claims

#### 1️⃣ Inspect Network Traffic
```bash
# Open Developer Tools (F12)
# Go to Network tab → Use the app normally
# Result: NO requests containing your mood data
```

#### 2️⃣ Examine Local Storage
```javascript
// Browser console (F12 → Console):
localStorage.getItem('cozy-critter-moods')
localStorage.getItem('cozy-critter-custom-messages')
// Shows data exists ONLY on your device
```

#### 3️⃣ Verify Offline Operation
```bash
# Turn off internet → App still works perfectly
# Your mood data is still accessible
# Proof: No external dependencies
```

#### 4️⃣ Review Source Code
We're open source — verify every claim:
- 📂 Mood Storage Logic: client/src/lib/mood-storage.ts — localStorage only
- 🗑️ Privacy Settings: client/src/components/privacy-settings.tsx — one-click delete
- 🔍 Search entire frontend: client/src — no mood data goes to servers

#### 5️⃣ Test Data Deletion
```bash
1. Add mood entries in the app
2. Go to Privacy & Data settings
3. Click "Delete All Data"
4. Check: localStorage.getItem('cozy-critter-moods') → null
```

### 🛡️ Technical Security Architecture

#### 💾 Client Side Only Storage
```typescript
// From mood-storage.ts - all data operations
localStorage.setItem(MOOD_STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(moods));
localStorage.getItem(MOOD_STORAGE_KEY);
localStorage.removeItem(MOOD_STORAGE_KEY);
// No fetch(), no axios, no external APIs for mood data
```

#### 🌐 Offline First PWA
```javascript
// Service Worker caches everything locally
caches.open(CACHE_NAME).then(cache => {
  return cache.addAll(STATIC_RESOURCES);
});
```

### 📊 Security Audit Results

#### ✅ Provably Secure
| Data Type | Security Level | Verification |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| Mood data | 100% local, never transmitted | Check Network tab |
| Custom messages | localStorage only | Browser console |
| App preferences | localStorage only | Browser console |
| User tracking | None — no analytics code | Source code review |
| External requests | None for personal data | Network tab |

#### ⚠️ Standard Web Risks (All Web Apps Have These)
- Dependency vulnerabilities — Standard npm issues (doesn't affect your data privacy)
- Browser security — Relies on your browser's security model
